**You may not collaborate with anyone on this challenge.**  You  _are_  allowed to use Internet documentation. If you  _do_  use existing code (either from Github, Stack Overflow, or other sources),  **please cite your sources in the README**.

## [](https://github.com/ACM-Research/-DRAFT-Coding-Challenge-S22#submission-procedure)Submission Procedure

Please follow the below instructions on how to submit your answers.

1.  Create a  **public**  fork of this repo and name it  `ACM-Research-Coding-Challenge-S22`. To fork this repo, click the button on the top right and click the "Fork" button.

2.  Clone the fork of the repo to your computer using  `git clone [the URL of your clone]`. You may need to install Git for this (Google it).

3.  Complete the Challenge based on the instructions below.

4.  Submit your solution by filling out this [form](https://acmutd.typeform.com/to/uTpjeA8G).

## Assessment Criteria 

Submissions will be evaluated holistically and based on a combination of effort, validity of approach, analysis, adherence to the prompt, use of outside resources (encouraged), promptness of your submission, and other factors. Your approach and explanation (detailed below) is the most weighted criteria, and partial solutions are accepted.

[Binary classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification) is a type of classification task that labels elements of a set (i.e. dataset) into two different groups. An example of this type of classification would be identifying if people had a specific disease or not based on certain health characteristics. The dataset found in `mushrooms.csv` holds data (22 different characteristics, specifically) about different types of mushrooms, including a mushroom's cap shape, cap surface texture, cap color, bruising, odor, and more. Remember to split the data into test and training sets (you can choose your own percent split). Information about the meaning of the letters under each column can be found within the file `attributelegend.txt`.

**With the file `mushrooms.csv`, use an algorithm of your choice to classify whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.**

**You may use any programming language you feel most comfortable. We recommend Python because it is the easiest to implement. You're allowed to use any library or API you want to implement this, just document which ones you used in this README file.** Try to complete this as soon as possible.

Regardless if you can or cannot answer the question, provide a short explanation of how you got your solution or how you think it can be solved in your README.md file. However, we highly recommend giving the challenge a try, you just might learn something new!

My Explanation
I have never worked with python or anything data science related so this was a very challenging assignment. My first action was to read up on binary classification, because I had heard it mentioned before somewhere but did not know exactly what it was. In the couple article i had read, I saw algorithms being mentioned and decided to start researching. i knew that i was trying to classify something and make a shot in the dark with the selection of algorithms and chose logistic regression at first. I looked up tutorials on youtube because i work better with visuals and was introduced to jupyter notebooks and anaconda software when dealing with python code. As i was working through the tutorial and jupyter ntebooks i realized a major mistake that i was making. all the data i had was qualitative and charistical, not quantitative. So i switched algorithms and restarted with decision trees. however the same issue was repeated because fundamentally data science requires numbers. I still decided to stick with decision tree regardless becuase when i was first introduced to the data and challenge, i subconsiously formed a decision tree in my mind. Eventually i worked all the way through using new knowledge i had learned and old knowledge i know from other languages.
